                <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
                One of the biggest mistakes I see people new to the workforce is not looking into the health insurances the company provides.
                One of the first things I like to do is see how much my health plan costs me over the cost of a year. There
                will always be people who don't use their health plan, don't be one of them. Set yourself up for success
                and use them, the big reason for things you are paying for it no matter what. Most companies force you too
                opt-in. So you might as well spend the money your spending on it at the bare minimum, this can include physio
                therapy, massages, dental, eye care, and more. Just make sure you see what your plan has to offer, and make
                sure you ask questions as well. Certain things like reflexology may not be on it, so doing a thorough read
                is really key. Also providing information about your plan to a dentist can be good, most dentist offices
                however have this ability, it just doesn't hurt as this can help you with different options on getting things
                looked at. I'm also a firm believer its better to suck it up and go to the scary dentist than have an issue
                later in life, especially given a nice smile can brighten up many other peoples days. Filing online is also
                key you'll get much better response times, than if you were to send by a regular mail. Also some places will
                file your information directly, and so they wont charge you till they find out the remaining balance. This
                is also a good idea as that way you are never out of pocket. Always ask if this is an option.

            <div id="p2" class="paragraphs"><h2>Car Insurance</h2>
                Now, going cheaper has its consequences - especially if you are accident prone. However its safe to say, however much you
                pay, if you get into an accident you'll pay more. So you'll have some questions to ask yourself, but at least
                you can take a look at some different options. Below are some websites to use.


                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.kanetix.ca">Kanetix</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.insurancehotline.com/">Insurance Hotline</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://isure.ca">isure</a></li>
                </ul>
                I suggest using all 3, you may get more options available for you through each one. This is one of the quickest and easiest
                ways to save yourself some money.

                <h2>Other Insurances</h2>
                There will always be insurances - anytime someone is willing to accept money to cover certain risks that others face, an insurance will exist. 
                I've heard and see a multitude - employee insurance, house insurance, disability insurances. And more. 
                I'm a big proponent of leveraging reddit too. <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/</a> has quite a few contributers, and any problem you face especially if you've never been through it before could be already posted there so its worth a search, they can offer some good non-biased advice. (They won't actively be looking to make any money from you.)

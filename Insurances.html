    Car insurance, health insurance, etc can affect your financial life a lot more than you realize.
    
    <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
    One of the biggest mistakes I see people new to the workforce is not looking into the health insurances the company provides.
    One of the first things I like to do is see how much my health plan costs me over the cost of a year. There will always be people who don't use their health plan, don't be one of them. Set yourself up for success and use them, the big reason for things
    you are paying for it no matter what. Most companies force you too opt-in. So you might as well spend the money your spending on it at the bare minimum, this can include physio therapy, massages, dental, eye care, and more. 
    Just make sure you see what your plan has to offer, and make sure you ask questions as well. Certain things like reflexology may not be on it, so doing a thorough read is really key. 


    Also providing information about your plan to a dentist can be good, most dentist offices however have this ability, it just doesn't hurt as this can help you with different options on getting things looked at. I'm also a firm believer its better to suck it up and go to the scary dentist than have an issue later in life, especially given a nice smile can brighten up many other peoples days.

    Filing online is also key you'll get much better response times, than if you were to send by a regular mail.  Also some places will file your information directly, and so they wont charge you till they find out the remaining balance. This is also a good idea as that way you are never out of pocket. Always ask if this is an option.

    <h2>Car Insurance</h2>
    Now, going cheaper has its consequences - especially if you are accident prone. However its safe to say, however much you pay, if you get into an accident you'll pay more. 
    So you'll have some questions to ask yourself, but at least you can take a look at some different options. Below are some websites to use. 


    <ul> 
        <li><a href="https://www.kanetix.ca">Kanetix</a> </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.insurancehotline.com/">Insurance Hotline</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://isure.ca">isure</a></li>
    </ul>
    I suggest using all 3, you may get more options available for you through each one. This is one of the quickest and easiest ways to save yourself some money.

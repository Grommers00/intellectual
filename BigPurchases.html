                Big Purchases are one of the most widely discussed and analyzed discussions. Myself included have been able to get some great deals, and some bad deals. 
                Learning why both happen is really critical. Financially a big purchase can end up being a big burden resulting in less savings for other big purchases, or a downgrade in day
                to day life such as not being able to eat out anymore. So what are some of the big questions to ask yourself?
                <ul>
                    <li>Do I really need this?</li>
                    <li>How many extra features am I paying for and what is the cost of those alone?</li>
                    <li>Did I negotiate as well as I should have?</li>
                    <li>Is this just reactionary?</li>
                </ul>

                I always have to ask myself these questions before any purchase, specifically a car. Many new cars are not worth the financial strain it will put on you, and unless you intend to include
                it on your entertainment budget, and yes driving in luxury can be considered an entertainment, I suggest not going that route. Just realize you may have to cut other places, to ensure you are still saving in other places.
                A car can say a lot about someone, much like their clothing, it can present an image to everyone else viewing. How important is your public image? Well, in some lines of work its very important. Could you imagine someone like Jay-Z driving around a corolla? Probaby not. 
                And someone on the other hand like the late Steve Jobs, he drove a Mercedes SL55 AMG. Its a nice car, but not normally what you would expect of his wealth.
                He was very practical with his purchases, and often tried to shy away from being in the media, much like other IT CEO's. 

                So what am I basically saying? Stop and ask yourself how much is that car going to help me? Do I really need those extra functionalities? How good is the gas going to be on it?
                Am I just doing it to be cool or impress someone? Have I considered all the other financial aspects of owning a car?

                Always make sure you have some kind of savings before making other big purchases. Too many people jump into something without actually having a safety egg. This can lead to a lot of unwanted forced decisions after.
                Such as cutting out part of your life style, moving back home, or cancelling other large financial commitments. Take your time to make big decisions, if it takes you 2 weeks to make the money that you need to purchase it. 
                Spending a week thinking about debating it can be worth it, and ASK people questions on what they did. This is a critical, and ask what issues they ran into.
                A lot of people are pretty open about discussing that problem. It doesn't have to be direct financial questions like "How much did that cost?" but more along the lines of
                "what additional expenses did you have to incur?", "what problems have you run into?". 

                Asking one person is good if they've experienced everything, but I always ask 3-4 people just to ensure to get a wide variety of answers. This is a fact of life, and a big purchase is key. 
                Also, if you think you know the answers to everything, stop and humble yourself..frankly nobody has made you king of the world yet.
